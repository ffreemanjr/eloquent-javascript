    <h1>The Fizzbuzz Conditional Exercise</h1>

    <p class="note">NOTE: To view my result to the exercise, please press the "F12" key, and click on the "Console" tab!</p>

    <p class="instruction">Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.
    </p>
    
    <p class="instruction">When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).
    </p>
    
    <p class="instruction">(This is actually an interview question that has been claimed to weed out a significant percentage of programmer candidates. So if you solved it, your labor market value just went up.)</p>
